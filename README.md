## About

This repository captures my learning journey through the classic software design patterns canon. Each example distils the intent of a pattern into concise, readable C# code, making the concepts easy to revisit and apply in day‑to‑day engineering work.

### Key points

* **Hands‑on focus** – every sample grew out of graded coursework assignments, so the code actually runs, not just compiles in theory.
* **Modern C# style** – newer language features are used where they clarify intent while preserving the spirit of the original patterns.
* **Self‑contained demos** – each pattern’s example can be run on its own without extra scaffolding.

> *“Design patterns are a shared language. These examples are my dictionary.”*
